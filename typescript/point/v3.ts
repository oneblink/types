         * Property
         * @description The Property API allows you to validate a State or National property reference (e.g. the NSW Valuer General's Property ID) and return a variety of information about the validated property, including:
         *
         *     - A unique identifier (contributorId) that links to the NSW Foundation Cadastral data.
         *     - A unique identifier (propertyPid) that links to Geoscape's National Property dataset.
         *     - A list of all cadastral parcels included in the property description.
         *     - Date created/modified.
         *     - Related addresses, cadastral parcel details, and administrative boundary information.
         *
         *     > The property data served via this API is sourced from Geoscape’s National Property Product. This dataset is updated monthly due to the current constraints of jurisdiction supply chains. Future enhancements aim to include more frequent updates to data currency
         *
         *     # Benefits
         *
         *     Integration of the Property API into government systems and databases enables seamless access to authoritative property, and property-related information for decision-making processes. This offers the benefits and insights that can be derived from spatial data without the necessity and overhead of maintaining an independent GIS system.
         *
         *     **Features of the Property API include:**
         *
         *     - Authoritative foundation spatial data sourced from Australia’s States and Territories.
         *     - Access to comprehensive address information for each validated property.
         *     - Configurable parameters that allow the service to be customised to your use case e.g. filter by state or alias address type, customisable Coordinate Reference Systems (CRS), define the additional information you would like included in the API response.
         *     - Administrative boundaries (Local Government Areas, State and Federal Electoral Divisions, ASGS Meshblock, Remoteness, SEIFA information).
         *     - Pagination functionality to assist in managing large volumes of property address information.
         *
         *     # Implementation and Best Practice
         *
         *     ## API Behaviour
         *
         *     This API requires the input of a property Id as a reference as a single string (e.g.`propertyId=2043147`). It returns a JSON response with a `propertyBundle` object that contains information about the validated property.
         *
         *     By default, the API will also return a single address related to the property where one can be found. The address and its attributes will be returned in an embedded GeoJSON `Feature Collection` object.
         *
         *     ### Properties with multiple addresses
         *
         *     Many Australian properties have multiple addresses. Some examples of properties with more than one address include: retirement villages, residential villages, residential or commercial apartment blocks, and private residences with a secondary dwelling. The Property API reports the total number of addresses associated with a property using the `numberMatched` attribute of the `links` object in the API response.
         *
         *     If required, the API can be customised to return all addresses for a validated property. However, as the number of addresses may be substantial and could impact the response size, it is advisable to implement pagination to effectively manage the data. *(Refer to the section on pagination in ‘Customising the request for your application’ for more details.)*
         *
         *     ## Input Format
         *
         *     The API is capable of validating both **jurisdictional** (State-supplied) Property Ids and **national** (Geoscape-generated) Identifiers using the one `propertyId` parameter.
         *
         *     Please refer to the appropriate section below depending upon your use case and the source of your input Property Id.
         *
         *     ### Jurisdictional Property Id Validation (State-supplied)
         *
         *     When seeking to validate a State-supplied property Id (such as the NSW Valuer General's Property Id used for NSW land valuation and ratings purposes); the `stateFilter` parameter **must** be included in the request. This alleviates the risk of incorrect validation where jurisdiction-supplied identifiers are duplicated, by ensuring that the Property Id is validated against the correct jurisdiction dataset.
         *
         *     >Jurisdiction Property Id's are also included in NSW Point API responses. They can be found in the `propertyBundle` under the name: `contributorId` and in the properties of address objects under the name `contributorPropertyId`.
         *
         *     Example of a request that includes a jurisdiction Property Id:
         *     `https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/api/property?propertyId=2043147&stateFilter=NSW`
         *
         *     For more information on the ‘stateFilter’ parameter, refer to the State and Territory Filtering section below.
         *
         *     For more information on NSW Land Valuation and Property Systems, please visit: https://www.nsw.gov.au/departments-and-agencies/department-of-planning-housing-and-infrastructure/nsw-valuer-general
         *
         *     ### National Property Id Validation (Geoscape-generated)
         *
         *     Geoscape are the creators and maintainers of the national property dataset. They aggregate property data received from each jurisdiction to form a single property product, see Geoscape Property Intelligence for more information: https://geoscape.com.au/solutions/property-intelligence/.
         *
         *     The Geoscape property dataset includes a persistent identifier (propertyPid) that is assigned to each record.
         *
         *     Our NSW Point Property API accepts and validates Geoscape propertyPids. When submitting a propertyPid for validation, it is not necessary to include the stateFilter parameter in the request because these identifiers are unique.
         *
         *     Example of a request that includes a Geoscape propertyPid:
         *     `https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/api/property?propertyId=prpb1bbf7129cf1`
         *
         *     For more detailed information on the Geoscape Property Product, please refer to: https://docs.geoscape.com.au/en/stable/property.html
         *
         *     ## Customising the request for your application
         *
         *     It is possible to customise the API request based on your project or application requirements.
         *
         *     The following optional parameters are available:
         *
         *     ### Pagination of API results
         *
         *     The Property API includes functionality to assist in implementing pagination of results in a web application.
         *
         *     This functionality is valuable when a property includes a large number of related addresses, as it allows you to request the addresses in smaller, more manageable batches. This reduces the API response time and enables you to control the number of addresses displayed per page.
         *
         *     The input parameters: `limit` and `offset` can be used to manage the maximum number of address records to return per page, and the starting record. Whilst the `links` object in the API response includes the following information:
         *
         *     - `numberMatched` – The total number of addresses that are related to the parcel.
         *     - `numberReturned` – The number of addresses returned in the current response.
         *     - `self` – A generated URL that can be used to refresh the currently requested record set.
         *     - `next` – A generated URL that can be used request the next record set from the total records.
         *     - `previous` – A generated URL that can be used request the previous record set from the total records.
         *
         *     **Pagination parameters:**
         *
         *     - `limit` - Sets the maximum number of addresses to return in a single request. The range is 1-1000 and the default is 1.
         *     - `offset` - Identifies the starting record that should be returned by the API. The range is 0-999 and the default is 0.
         *
         *     **Example of a request using pagination:**
         *
         *     `https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/api/property?propertyId=prp812e7f8b8b26&limit=10&offset=0`
         *
         *     **Example of the links section of the response for the above request:**
         *     ```json
         *     "links": {
         *             "numberMatched": 105,
         *             "numberReturned": 10,
         *             "self": "/v3/api/property?propertyId=prp812e7f8b8b26&offset=0&limit=10",
         *             "next": "/v3/api/property?propertyId=prp812e7f8b8b26&offset=10&limit=10"
         *         }
         *     ```
         *
         *     ### State/Territory Filtering
         *
         *     The `stateFilter` parameter is used to restrict the API to one specific Australian state or territory. Unlike other NSW Point V3 APIs, the stateFilter in the Property API only accepts a single unique state reference, this is to ensure that the correct jurisdictional dataset is queried.
         *
         *     If you are attempting to validate a state-supplied `propertyId`, you **must** include this parameter in your request.
         *
         *     Example: `stateFilter=NSW`
         *
         *     ### Address Dataset Filtering
         *
         *     The `dataset` parameter allows you to restrict the dataset from which related addresses are returned. This can be useful when you only want to return authoritative addresses for validated ‘propertyId’s’.
         *
         *     **Dataset options include:**
         *
         *      - **GNAF** – The most comprehensive national address dataset that includes *authoritative* and *non-authoritative* addresses from multiple contributors (updated quarterly) e.g. `dataset=gnaf`
         *     - **GNAF Live/Geoscape continuousAddress** – The most current *authoritative* address dataset (updated daily from the Australian State and Territory address jurisdictions) e.g. `dataset=continuousAddress`
         *
         *     If no dataset is specified in your request, addresses will be returned from all datasets.
         *
         *     ### Alias/Principal Address Filtering
         *
         *     The `excludeAliases` parameter allows you to force the exclusion of alias addresses from the Property API (e.g. addresses where `"aliasPrincipal": "ALIAS"`).
         *
         *     **Alias addresses** are non-authoritative addresses that have been provided by an address contributor or determined programmatically. For example, “10-12 SMITH STREET" could be an alias for the principal address: “10 SMITH STREET”.
         *
         *     By default, alias addresses are included in the API response. If you *do not* want to receive alias addresses, you must set the ‘excludeAliases’ value to ‘true’.
         *
         *     Use of the 'excludeAliases' parameter will not restrict the validation of the input `propertyId`. It will only limit the type of addresses that might be returned with the validated ‘propertyId’.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *
         *     - **true**: Excludes alias addresses from the response, only addresses with an `"aliasPrincipal": "PRINCIPAL"` will be returned.
         *     - **false** (default): Includes both ALIAS and PRINCIPAL addresses in the response.
         *
         *     Example: `excludeAliases=True`
         *
         *     ### Requesting additional properties for address locations
         *
         *     The API includes functionality that allows you to request a variety of other information related to the physical address location. These items are requested using the optional parameter `additionalProperties`.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *
         *     - `asgsMain`
         *     - `asgsRemoteness`
         *     - `commonwealthElectorate`
         *     - `parcelBundle`
         *     - `localGovernmentArea`
         *     - `seifa`
         *     - `stateElectorateBundle`
         *
         *     Example: `additionalProperties=stateElectorateBundle,localGovernmentArea`
         *
         *     ***Note:** The contents of ‘propertyBundle’ are returned in the default response by this API. Therefore it is not available as an 'additionalProperties' option.*
         *
         *     For more information on 'additionalProperties' values and administrative boundary data, please refer to our [Additional Properties Knowledgebase Article](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/knowledge-base.html#additional-properties).
         *
         *     ### Requesting Geographic Coordinates in a Different Reference System
         *
         *     The API can be configured to return the geographic coordinates in the response using the `Accept-Crs` parameter in your request header.
         *
         *     The following Coordinate Reference Systems are supported:
         *
         *     **Supported CRS** | **Parameter Value**
         *     ---------|----------
         *     **GDA2020** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *     **GDA94**| `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4283>`
         *     **WGS84** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326>`
         *     **AGD66** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4202>`
         *
         *     Example: `Accept-Crs=<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *
         *     You can find more information about EPSG codes and preferred transformations in NSW here: https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/230429/Common_Australian_EPSG_Codes_and_Transformations_Information_Sheet.pdf
         *
         *     ## Suggestions for implementation
         *
         *     ### Data Complexity - A Word of Caution!
         *
         *     The relationships between cadastral parcels, properties, and addresses in Australia are complex. Generally, most parcels have one related property and at least one address. However, there are various edge cases and scenarios within the data that can affect this outcome.
         *
         *     Some known examples in NSW data that may impact the Property API include:
         *
         *     - **Properties that do not return related address information** - A significant number of NSW properties may not have been assigned a complete address by the authority responsible for addressing them. Examples of this include rail corridors, parks, reserves, vacant land or government owned properties. In the even that a propertyId is validated but does not include any addresses in the response, this is the most likely cause.
         *     - **Stratum Properties** - The NSW Cadastre currently provides a 2D representation of cadastral parcels that are at 'ground level' only. Any properties related to parcels that are found above or below ground level may not be validated using the NSW Point Property API. Examples of potentially affected properties include: underground mining leases, underground car parks or basement levels, and developments that include properties positioned in the airspace above ground level.
         *     - **Properties with ambiguous parcel or address relationships** - Some properties may have more than one related parcel or primary or secondary address record. These ambiguous relationships can have unforeseen impacts on the expected behaviour of the API.
         *
         *     If you have any concerns or questions regarding the impact of these scenarios on your application, please [contact our support team](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/contact-us.html) for advice.
         *
         *     ### Handling for special characters "^" and "%"
         *
         *     The following special characters, `^` and `%`, are considered "unsafe" for use in URLs. Including these characters will result in an error in the client’s browser, preventing the request from being sent to the NSW Point Server.
         *
         *     This issue can occur in any input field on a web form where users can enter alphanumeric characters (e.g. the `address` input field in forms using the NSW Point ‘GET Suggested Addresses’ API).
         *
         *     Spatial Services recommend that developers implement validation in their application to prevent these characters from being entered by end-users to avoid this issue.
         *
         *     Please see the following link for additional information on unsafe characters: https://perishablepress.com/stop-using-unsafe-characters-in-urls/
         *
         *     ## Output Format
         *
         *     **Response Format:** JSON format, typically containing a [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) `featureCollection` object.
         *
         *     The output includes information for the validated 'property' in the `propertyBundle` object.
         *
         *     If  the property has related addresses, they will be provided as a GeoJSON 'featureCollection' object.
         *
         *     The 'featureCollection' will contain:
         *
         *     - a `links` object, which provides the information necessary for implementing pagination.
         *     - One or more address `feature` objects.
         *
         *     Each 'feature' will include:
         *
         *     - A `geometry` object containing the geographic coordinates of the address.
         *     - A `properties` object with standard NSW Point address attributes.
         *     - The 'properties' object will also include any 'additionalProperties' requested with the `propertyId ’ e.g. administrative boundaries and parcel information, etc.
         *

         * GET Suggested Addresses
         * @description This API functions as an **address suggestion engine**, designed for integration into online forms where customer addresses are entered. The API generates accurate address suggestions based on the customer's input and presents the response as an array that can be used in a selectable drop-down list. Address suggestions provided by the API are sourced from national authoritative physical and postal address datasets.
         *
         *     Once a customer selects an address from the suggestions, its `addressId` can be used in the **GET Address by ID** API to retrieve additional details about the address and its location.
         *
         *     # Benefits
         *
         *     Using this API to assist in capturing customer addresses provides significant benefits, such as automated data entry, accurate data maintenance, compliance and reporting, enhanced user experience when completing forms, and immediate corrections and suggestions as users enter address details.
         *

         *     The `address` is the only required parameter for this API. It should contain an alphanumeric string that represents partial address information provided by an end user e.g. `address=346 Pan`.
         *
         *     The API also includes the following customisable parameters:
         *
         *     - `maxResults`
         *     - `stateFilter`
         *     - `dataset`
         *     - `addressType`
         *     - `excludeAliases`
         *
         *     ## Output Format
         *
         *     **Response Format:** [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)
         *
         *     The API response will include an array containing:
         *
         *     - Valid `address` suggestions based on upon customer input.
         *     - A unique `id` for each address.
         *     - A `rank` system that determines the order in which addresses appear in the drop-down list when multiple addresses are returned.
         *
         *     ## API Behaviour
         *
         *     This API requires the input of partial address information as a single string e.g. `address=346 Pan`
         *
         *     By default, it will return a JSON response containing up to five suggestions based on the `address` value.
         *
         *     ### Fuzzy Matching:
         *
         *     This API uses advanced machine learning to:
         *
         *     - Deliver fast and accurate address suggestions from authoritative datasets as customers type.
         *     - Allow for spelling errors in street names and localities during address entry.
         *     - Support locality alias and neighbour matching, recognising when users input incorrect or neighbouring locality names, and provide suggestions with the correct authoritative locality name.
         *     - Offer enhanced error tolerance for street numbers and street types, accommodating user mistakes or formatting errors in these elements.
         *
         *     ## Customising the request for your application
         *
         *     It is possible to customise the API request based on your project or application requirements.
         *
         *     The following options are available:
         *
         *     ### Maximum number of address suggestions returned
         *
         *     The `maxResults` parameter allows you to set the maximum number of suggested addresses returned in the API response. The actual number of suggestions returned will depend on how many successful matches are found for the 'address' value. The `maxResults` value must be a number between 1 and 20, with a default of 5.
         *
         *     Example: `maxResults=10`
         *
         *     ### State/Territory Filtering
         *
         *     You can use the `stateFilter` parameter to restrict the API's suggestions to one or more specific Australian states or territories. Separate each state or territory with a comma. This is useful when you need customers to receive suggestions only from the nominated states and territories. If `stateFilter` is not used, the API will return suggestions from all Australian states and territories.
         *
         *     Example: `stateFilter=NSW,QLD`
         *
         *     ### Source Dataset Filtering
         *
         *     The `dataset` parameter allows you to nominate the dataset you are returning your address suggestions from.
         *
         *     Dataset options include:
         *
         *
         *     Dataset  | Description  | Example
         *     ---------|----------|---------
         *      **GNAF** | The most comprehensive national address dataset (updated quarterly)| `dataset=gnaf`
         *      **GNAF Live/Geoscape continuousAddress** | The most current address dataset (updated daily from the Australian State and Territory address authorities) |  `dataset=gnaflive`
         *      **Geoscape Mail Address** | Postal address suggestions derived from Australia Post’s PAF dataset, including PO Boxes, RMB etc (Updated quarterly)  | `dataset=mailAddress`
         *
         *     You can combine values together into a comma separated string to query multiple datasets at the same time. If no dataset is nominated, suggestions will be returned from all datasets.
         *
         *     Example: `dataset=gnaflive,mailAddress`
         *
         *     ### Physical/Postal Address Filtering
         *
         *     The `addressType` parameter lets you restrict the suggestions returned by the API to either ‘physical’ or ‘mailing’ addresses when needed. If `addressType` is not included in your request, both types will be suggested by default.
         *
         *
         *     | addressType | Description |
         *     |----------|----------|
         *     | **Physical addresses**     | addresses assigned to a physical location within NSW or Australia. Many physical addresses are also mailing addresses (e.g., most people receive mail at their physical home address). However, some locations and properties assigned a physical address by authorities do not receive mail (e.g., an empty rural paddock, public park, or vacant railway land).      |
         *     | **Mailing addresses**      | addresses that are recognised by Australia Post for the delivery of mail services. Mailing addresses include some physical addresses that receive mail (e.g., your home address) as well as postal-only addresses such as PO Boxes, GPO Boxes or RMB addresses.       |
         *
         *
         *
         *     Example: `addressType=mailing`
         *
         *
         *     ### Alias/Principal Address Filtering
         *
         *     The `excludeAliases` parameter determines whether alias addresses are included in suggestions. **Alias addresses** are non-authoritative addresses that have been provided by an address contributor or determined by programmatically. For example, 10-12 SMITH STREET could be an alias for the principal address 10 SMITH STREET. By default, alias suggestions are included in the API response.
         *
         *     Accepted values for the `excludeAliases` parameter are:
         *
         *     - **true**: Excludes alias addresses, using only the principal dataset (GNAF-live).
         *     - **false** (default): Includes alias addresses.
         *
         *     Example: `excludeAliases=true`
         *
         *     ## Suggestions for implementation
         *
         *     It is recommended that the following techniques are implemented in your application to reduce the number of API calls required.
         *
         *     ### Implement a “Minimum Four Keystrokes” Rule
         *
         *     The `address` parameter requires a minimum of **four characters** in the input string to return any address suggestions. Configure your application to send requests only after your end users' fourth keystroke.
         *
         *     ### Debouncing
         *
         *     Configure your application to include a debounce strategy. e.g. time delayed requests, or delay sending requests until there is a pause in user’s input.
         *
         *     ### Handling for special characters "^" and "%"
         *
         *     The following special characters, `^` and `%`, are considered "unsafe" for use in URLs. Including these characters will result in an error in the client’s browser, preventing the request from being sent to the NSW Point Server.
         *
         *     This issue can occur in any input field on a web form where users can enter alphanumeric characters (e.g. the `address` input field in forms using the NSW Point ‘GET Suggested Addresses’ API).
         *
         *     Spatial Services recommend that developers implement validation in their application to prevent these characters from being entered by end-users to avoid this issue.
         *
         *     Please see the following link for additional information on unsafe characters: https://perishablepress.com/stop-using-unsafe-characters-in-urls/
         *
         *     ### Implementation of a ‘I can’t find my address’ solution
         *
         *     It is recommended that you implement functionality in your application that allows your customers to proceed with their service request or transaction if their address is not returned as a suggestion. This will provide your customers with a better experience by offering them an alternative option for entering their address. For more information on what an “I can’t find my address” solution might include, please [contact us.](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/contact-us.html)

         * GET an Address by ID
         * @description The **Get an Address by ID** API is an Address ID verification and location information service.
         *
         *     Customers can submit an `addressId` for a physical or postal address that is sourced from the **Get Suggested Address** API and return a variety of address and location-related information.
         *
         *     # Benefits
         *
         *     Paired with the **Get Suggested Address** API, the **Get an Address by ID** API enhances address data quality and consistency. The API offers:
         *
         *     - Authoritative national address data in a parsed and unparsed format
         *     - Cadastral, coordinate and property information.
         *     - Administrative boundaries (Local Government Areas, State and Federal Electoral Divisions, ASGS Meshblock, Remoteness, SEIFA information).
         *     - Customisable Coordinate Reference Systems (GDA94, GDA2020, WGS84, AGD66).
         *
         *     # Implementation and Best Practice
         *
         *     ## Input Format
         *
         *     This API requires the input of a `addressId` as a single alphanumeric string.
         *
         *     Accepted formats include:
         *
         *     | Dataset | example |
         *     |----------|----------|
         *     | **GNAF**      | `addressId=GANSW718129285`       |
         *     | **GNAF Live/Geoscape continuousAddress**       | `addressId=add6ccf666f211a`       |
         *     | **Geoscape mailAddress**       | `addressId=MA9589716`       |
         *
         *
         *
         *     The API includes optional parameters that allow you to customise the response format and content to suit your application's needs.
         *
         *
         *     ### Requesting 'additionalProperties' for address locations
         *
         *     The API includes functionality that allows you to request a variety of additional information related to the physical address location. These items can be requested using the `additionalProperties` parameter.
         *
         *     The following additional properties are available:
         *
         *     - `asgsMain`
         *     - `asgsRemoteness`
         *     - `commonwealthElectorate`
         *     - `localGovernmentArea`
         *     - `parcelBundle`
         *     - `propertyBundle`
         *     - `seifa`
         *     - `stateElectorateBundle`
         *
         *     Example: `additionalProperties=parcelBundle,localGovernmentArea`
         *
         *     For more information on `additionalProperties` values and administrative boundary data, please refer to our [Additional Properties Knowledge Base Article](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/knowledge-base.html#additional-properties).
         *
         *     ### Requesting geographic coordinates in a different reference system
         *
         *     The API can be configured to return the geographic coordinates in the response using the `Accept-Crs` parameter in your request header.
         *
         *     The following Coordinate Reference Systems are supported:
         *
         *     **Supported CRS** | **Parameter Value**
         *     ---------|----------
         *      **GDA2020** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *      **GDA94**| `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4283>`
         *      **WGS84** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326>`
         *     **AGD66** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4202>`
         *
         *     Example: `Accept-Crs=<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *
         *     You can find more information about Accept-CRS and Coordinate Reference Systems [here.](https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/230429/Common_Australian_EPSG_Codes_and_Transformations_Information_Sheet.pdf)
         *
         *     ## Output Format
         *
         *     **Response Format:** [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)
         *
         *     **Object Style:** `feature`
         *
         *     The API output will include the address information for the validated `addressId` within a single address 'feature' object.
         *
         *     Address features will include the following:
         *
         *     - A `geometry` object that contains the geographic coordinates for the address.
         *     - A `properties` object that includes parsed and unparsed address information and other address attributes.
         *     - The 'properties' of each 'feature' will also include any 'additionalProperties' that were requested with the 'parcelId' e.g. administrative boundaries and property information, etc.
         *
         *     > Address Id’s that are sourced from the **mailAddress** dataset will return a geometry object that contains `"coordinates":[null,null]` because postal-only addresses do not include spatial information.

         * Geocode Address
         * @description The Geocode Address API provides a service for validating and geocoding physical addresses. Users can submit addresses in either parsed or unparsed formats, and the API can validate both complete and partial address information. It is capable of returning address, street and locality geocode matches.
         *
         *     Validated responses will include:
         *
         *     - Geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude) for each match result.
         *     - Matched address information in both parsed and unparsed formats.
         *     - Metadata that assists in understanding the match quality and accuracy.
         *     -  A parsed version of the raw input address.
         *     - A range of optional address location-related information.
         *
         *     > The Geocode Address API does not validate “postal-only” addresses such as PO or GPO Boxes because they are not physical addresses. If you require the validation of postal addresses, you should use our [Mail Point API](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/api-document.html#/paths/api-mailpoint/get).
         *
         *     # Benefits
         *
         *     This service transforms basic addresses into geographic coordinates that can be displayed on a map. This capability helps organisations pinpoint exact locations, supporting strategic planning, enabling informed decisions based on spatial context, facilitating tasks ranging from delivery services to emergency response planning.
         *
         *     Additionally, the Geocode Address service can be used to validate, standardise and enrich existing address datasets. This can provide vital assistance to organisations that are undertaking system enhancements or upgrades because it allows you to verify the quality of your existing address data and standardise the format before migrating the enriched data into your new system.
         *
         *     # Implementation and Best Practice
         *
         *     ## API Behaviour
         *
         *     By default, the API returns one complete address that best matches the input address information. If this fails, it falls back to returning a street match, and then a locality match.
         *
         *     It is possible to customise the API request in various ways to suit your application needs or validation purposes, including:
         *
         *     - Specifying the type of match or minimum geocode accuracy you require.
         *     - Defining the number of suggestions you would like the API to offer for each input address.
         *     - Filtering the match results by state and territory, dataset, or address type.
         *     - Enriching your system by capturing address-location-related information.
         *
         *     ### Fuzzy Matching:
         *
         *     This API uses advanced machine learning to:
         *
         *     - Deliver fast and accurate address suggestions from authoritative datasets as customers type.
         *     - Allow for user spelling errors in street names and localities during address entry.
         *     - Support locality alias and neighbour matching, recognising when users input incorrect or neighbouring locality names, and providing suggestions with the correct authoritative locality name.
         *     - Offer enhanced error tolerance for street numbers and street types, accommodating user mistakes or formatting errors in these elements.
         *
         *     ## Input Format
         *
         *     The minimum required parameters to form a valid request are: `address`, `streetName` or `localityName`. All other parameters are optional.
         *
         *     The API has the flexibility to accept address information in variety of formats using combinations of discrete address components that are offered as optional parameters.
         *
         *
         *     | Common input formats | Example  |
         *     |----------|----------|
         *     | Single unparsed address string   | `address=346 PANORAMA AVENUE BATHURST NSW 2795`   |
         *     | Partially parsed address string  | `address=346 PANORAMA AVENUE`, `localityName=BATHURST`, `stateTerritory=NSW`, `postcode=2795`   |
         *     | Fully parsed address elements  | `streetNumber1=346`, `streetName=PANORAMA`, `streetType=AVENUE`, `localityName=BATHURST`, `stateTerritory=NSW`, `postcode=2795`   |
         *
         *     A complete list of discrete address components supported as input parameters:
         *
         *     - `complexUnitType`
         *     - `complexUnitIdentifier`
         *     - `complexLevelType`
         *     - `complexLevelNumber`
         *     - `streetNumber1`
         *     - `streetNumber2`
         *     - `streetName`
         *     - `streetType`
         *     - `streetSuffix`
         *     - `siteName`
         *     - `lotIdentifier`
         *     - `localityName`
         *     - `stateTerritory`
         *     - `postcode`
         *
         *     ## Customising the request for your application
         *
         *     It is possible to customise the API request based on your project or application requirements.
         *
         *     The following options are available:
         *
         *     ### Maximum number of address suggestions returned
         *
         *     By default, only one address suggestion will be included in the API response. The `maxResults` parameter allows you to adjust the number of suggestions you would like returned by the API, up to a maximum of 20 addresses.
         *
         *     When multiple suggestions are included in a response, the addresses will be ranked by `matchScore` from highest to lowest. If two or more suggestions have the same matchScore value, they will be treated as equal quality matches and listed in no specific order.
         *
         *     In the event that an input address returns an exact match (matchScore = 100), only the single matching address will be included in the response, regardless of the 'maxResults' value.
         *
         *     Example: `maxResults=10`
         *
         *     ### State and Territory Filtering
         *
         *     You can use the `stateFilter` parameter to restrict the API's suggestions to one or more specific Australian states or territories. To do so, separate each abbreviated state or territory name with a comma. If `stateFilter` is not used, the API will return suggestions from all Australian states and territories.
         *
         *     Example: `stateFilter=NSW,QLD`
         *
         *     ### Source Dataset Filtering
         *
         *     The `dataset` parameter allows you to nominate the dataset you are returning your address suggestions from. Dataset options include:
         *
         *     - **GNAF** – The most comprehensive national address dataset that includes authoritative and non-authoritative addresses from multiple contributors (updated quarterly) e.g. `dataset=gnaf`
         *     - **GNAF Live/Geoscape continuousAddress** – The most current authoritative address dataset (updated daily from the Australian State and Territory address jurisdictions) e.g. `dataset=continuousAddress`
         *
         *     You can combine values together into a comma separated string to query multiple datasets at the same time. If no dataset is nominated in a request, suggestions will be returned from all datasets.
         *
         *     Example: `dataset=gnaf,continuousAddress`
         *
         *     ### Alias/Principal Address Filtering
         *
         *     The `excludeAliases` parameter determines whether alias addresses will be included as suggestions. **Alias addresses** are non-authoritative addresses provided by an address contributor or determined programmatically. For example, “10-12 SMITH STREET” could be an alias for the principal address: “10 SMITH STREET”.
         *
         *     By default, alias suggestions are included in the API response. If you *do not* want to receive alias suggestions, you must set the 'excludeAliases' value to true.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *
         *     - **true**: Excludes alias addresses from the response, only addresses with an `"aliasPrincipal":"PRINCIPAL"` will be returned.
         *     - **false** (default): Includes both ALIAS and PRINCIPAL addresses in the response.
         *
         *     Example: `excludeAliases=true`
         *
         *     ### Filter by matchType
         *
         *     The `matchType` parameter is used to filter results by their address type or completeness. When used, it restricts the API to only returning suggestions from the specified ‘matchType’ values you define in your request. E.g., `matchType=address` will force the API to only return complete address matches.
         *
         *     ‘matchType’ accepts a comma-separated list of values, allowing for a best-effort response that prioritises the most detailed address type (such as secondary or primary) and, if necessary, returns a less detailed address (such as street or locality). E.g., `matchType=primaryAddress,street` will attempt to find a primary address match, and if that fails, look for a ‘street’ level match only. However, if a ‘street’ level match cannot be found, it will *not* attempt to find a ‘locality’ level match.
         *
         *     If ‘matchType’ is not included in a request, the API will attempt to return the best suggestions it can for the input address, regardless of their ‘matchType’ value.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *     - `primaryAddress`
         *     - `secondaryAddress`
         *     - `address`
         *     - `street`
         *     - `locality`
         *
         *     Example: `matchType=primaryAddress,street`
         *
         *     > Choosing a `matchType=street` or `matchType=locality` will also restrict the spatial accuracy of the geoFeature that is returned by the API because an address without a Street Number or Street Name has a lower quality geocode accuracy.
         *
         *     ### Filter by geoFeature
         *
         *     The `minGeoFeatureLevel` parameter provides filtering based on the level of geoFeature accuracy. It operates as a “sliding scale” and allows you to define the minimum spatial accuracy you are willing to accept for your geocoding result. For example, `minGeoFeatureLevel=address` will only return matches that have a spatial accuracy of property address or better. Whilst, `minGeoFeatureLevel=streetLocality` will return suggestions from the categories of ‘address’, ‘approximate’, or ‘streetLocality’. For more information on ‘geoFeature’ values and the minGeoFeatureLevel categories, see [geoFeature]( https://api-docs.geoscape.com.au/docs/oas-addresses-api/2949837e92418-geo-).
         *
         *     If ‘minGeoFeatureLevel’ is not included in a request, the API will attempt to return the best suggestions it can for the input address, regardless of their geoFeature value.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *     - `address`
         *     - `approximate`
         *     - `streetLocality`
         *     - `locality`
         *
         *     Example: `minGeoFeatureLevel=address`
         *
         *     ### Requesting Additional Properties for Address Location
         *
         *     The API includes functionality that allows to you request a variety of other information related to the physical address location. These items are requested using the optional parameter `additionalProperties`.
         *
         *     *Accepted Values:*
         *     - `asgsMain`
         *     - `asgsRemoteness`
         *     - `commonwealthElectorate`
         *     - `localGovernmentArea`
         *     - `parcelBundle`
         *     - `propertyBundle`
         *     - `seifa`
         *     - `stateElectorateBundle`
         *
         *     Example: `additionalProperties=parcelBundle,localGovernmentArea`
         *
         *     For more information on `additionalProperties` values and administrative boundary data, please refer to our [Additional Properties Knowledgebase Article](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/knowledge-base.html#additional-properties).
         *
         *     ### Requesting Geographic Coordinates in a Different Reference System
         *
         *     The API can be configured to return the geographic coordinates in the response using the `Accept-Crs` parameter in your request header.
         *
         *     The following Coordinate Reference Systems are supported:
         *
         *     **Supported CRS** | **Parameter Value**
         *     ---------|----------
         *     **GDA2020** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *     **GDA94**| `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4283>`
         *     **WGS84** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326>`
         *     **AGD66** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4202>`
         *
         *     Example: `Accept-Crs=<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *
         *     You can find more information about EPSG codes and preferred transformations in NSW [here](https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/230429/Common_Australian_EPSG_Codes_and_Transformations_Information_Sheet.pdf).
         *
         *     ## Suggestions for implementation
         *
         *     It is recommended that the following techniques are implemented in your application to reduce the handling errors:
         *
         *     ### Handling for special characters "^" and "%"
         *
         *     The following special characters, `^` and `%`, are considered "unsafe" for use in URLs. Including these characters will result in an error in the client’s browser, preventing the request from being sent to the NSW Point Server.
         *
         *     This issue can occur in any input field on a web form where users can enter alphanumeric characters (e.g. the `address` input field in forms using the NSW Point ‘GET Suggested Addresses’ API).
         *
         *     Spatial Services recommend that developers implement validation in their application to prevent these characters from being entered by end-users to avoid this issue.
         *
         *     Please see the following link for additional information on unsafe characters: https://perishablepress.com/stop-using-unsafe-characters-in-urls/
         *     ## Output Format
         *
         *     Response Format: [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)
         *
         *     Object Style: `featureCollection` containing one or more address `feature` objects
         *
         *     Address features may include the following:
         *
         *     - A `geometry` object that contains the geographic coordinates for the address.
         *     - A `properties` object that includes parsed and unparsed address information and other address attributes.
         *     - The 'properties' of each 'feature' will also include any 'additionalProperties' that were requested with the 'parcelId' e.g. administrative boundaries and property information, etc.
         *     - Address matching attribution and `matchCode` object to assist in determining the quality and accuracy of the matched address.
         *     - A `query` attribute that includes the original input address.
         *     - A `parsedQuery` object that contains a parsed version of the input address.
         *
         *
         *     ### Match Quality Metadata
         *
         *     The Geocode Address API includes match quality metadata as part of its response. This information assists customers to understand the quality and confidence of the matches that are returned by the API.
         *
         *
         *     #### matchType
         *
         *     `matchType` broadly categorises the type of match that has been returned by the API and its approximate spatial accuracy.
         *
         *     *Values include:*
         *     - `Primary Address` - The result is a primary street address with no unit or level information
         *     - `Secondary Address` - The result is a secondary address with unit or level information
         *     - `Street` - The result is a street segment in a locality (streetLocality)
         *     - `Locality` - The result is a locality
         *
         *     **Example:** `"matchType":"Primary Address"`
         *
         *     #### matchScore
         *
         *     `matchScore` is a numeric value that indicates the "confidence" score of an address match from 0-100. The lower the score, the more differences there are between the input and output address. 'matchScore' and 'matchQuality' are directly related to each other and can be used in collaboration to understand the relative scoring of a match against another. *Please note, that 'matchScore' is not a percentage measure.*
         *
         *     **Example:** `"matchScore":99`
         *
         *
         *     #### matchQuality
         *
         *     `matchQuality` is a string value that assists in categorising the quality and confidence of an address match provided by the Geocode Address API using simple language. It is derived from the 'matchScore' numeric values and can be used to get a quick interpretation of the quality.
         *
         *     *Values include:*
         *
         *     - `Exact` - The returned address matches the input address exactly
         *     - `Confident` - The returned address is a potential match for the given input, and minimal assumptions are made about the match
         *     - `Good` - The returned address is a probable match for the given input, and some assumptions have been about the match
         *     - `Poor` - The returned address is a possible match for the given input (maybe one of many), multiple assumptions have been made about the match
         *
         *     **Example:** `"matchQuality":"Confident"`
         *
         *     ##### matchCode
         *
         *     The `matchCode` object provides a break down each individual address element describing how they match between the input address and the  output address match. This information can be used to better understand the match result was derived a match by the address matching engine.
         *
         *     *Values inlcude:*
         *
         *     **VALUE** | **DESCRIPTION**
         *     ---------|----------
         *     **exact** | The address element matched exactly, no changes were made
         *     **fuzzy**| The address element matched using fuzzy matching this could have been a spelling mistake or incorrect use of plural
         *     **phonetic** | The address element matched using phonetic matching the matched word sounds the same
         *     **alias** | The address element matched an alias exactly
         *     **neighbour** | The address element matched a locality neighbour exactly
         *     **neigbour_fuzzy** | The address element matched a locality neighbour using fuzzy matching
         *     **alias_fuzzy** | The address element matched an alias using fuzzy matching
         *     **partial** | The address element is multi-word and one of those words was matched exactly
         *     **in_range** | The address element matched as a number inside a ranged address, Odd and Even is taken into account to ensure only matched on the same side of the road is possible
         *     **close** | The address element did not match but the number was close to the matched addresses street number
         *
         *     **Example:**
         *
         *     ```json
         *     "matchCode": {
         *                     "streetName": "fuzzy",
         *                     "localityName": "exact",
         *                     "stateTerritory": "exact",
         *                     "postcode": "exact",
         *                     "streetNumber1": "exact",
         *                     "streetType": "exact"
         *                 }
         *     ```
         *

         * MailPoint
         * @description This API is designed for the validation of addresses used in mail delivery. It can validate both postal and physical addresses.
         *
         *     Features include:
         *
         *     - Address Matching: Utilises Australia Post's Postal Address File (PAF), a comprehensive database of Australian postal addresses.
         *     - Delivery Point Identifiers: Generates a Delivery Point Identifier (DPID) and a Delivery Point Barcode ID for each matched address, facilitating the creation of barcodes for efficient mail processing.
         *     - Location Information: Provides coordinates for physical addresses found in GNAF/GNAF Live. Please note that postal-only addresses (e.g., PO Boxes) will not return location information.
         *
         *     > Australia Post address data provided by this service is updated quarterly. For more information please review the [AusPost Data Guide](https://auspost.com.au/content/dam/auspost_corp/media/documents/australia-post-data-guide.pdf).
         *
         *     # Benefits
         *
         *     **AMAS Certified Address Validation for Bulk Mail**
         *
         *     The Address Matching Approval System (AMAS) is the certification program we use to assess the accuracy of address matching software. AMAS ensures that your software is approved to:
         *
         *     - Correct and match addresses against Australia Post's Postal Address File (PAF), a database of Australian postal addresses within our delivery network.
         *     - Add a unique Delivery Point Identifier (DPID) to each address record, enabling the generation of barcodes for your mail.
         *
         *     By using AMAS, you can also qualify for Bulk Mailout discounts from AusPost
         *
         *     # Implementation and Best Practice
         *
         *     ### API Behaviour
         *
         *     By default, the API returns **one** complete address that best matches the input address information. A match is only returned when the service is confident that the address can receive mail delivery by Australia Post.
         *
         *     ## Input Format
         *
         *     The minimum required parameters to form a valid request are: `address` or `localityName`. All other parameters are optional.
         *
         *     The API has the flexibility to accept address information in variety of formats, using combinations of discrete address components offered as optional parameters.
         *
         *     | Common input formats | Example |
         *     |----------|----------|
         *     | Single unparsed address string  | `address=346 PANORAMA AVENUE BATHURST NSW 2795`   |
         *     | Partially parsed address string   | `address=346 PANORAMA AVENUE`, `localityName=BATHURST`, `stateTerritory=NSW`, `postcode=2795`  |
         *     | Fully parsed address elements  | `streetNumber1=346`, `streetName=PANORAMA`, `streetType=AVENUE`, `localityName=BATHURST`, `stateTerritory=NSW`, `postcode=2795`   |
         *
         *     Complete list of discrete address components supported as input parameters:
         *
         *     - `postalDeliveryTypeCode`
         *     - `postalDeliveryIdentifier`
         *     - `complexUnitType`
         *     - `complexUnitIdentifier`
         *     - `complexLevelType`
         *     - `complexLevelNumber`
         *     - `streetNumber1`
         *     - `streetNumber2`
         *     - `streetName`
         *     - `streetType`
         *     - `streetSuffix`
         *     - `siteName`
         *     - `lotIdentifier`
         *     - `localityName`
         *     - `stateTerritory`
         *     - `postcode`
         *
         *     For definitions of address attribution please see our [Knowledge Base](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/knowledge-base.html#api-attribution).
         *
         *     ### Requesting geographic coordinates in a different reference system
         *
         *     The API can be configured to return the geographic coordinates in the response using the `Accept-Crs` parameter in your request header.
         *
         *     The following Coordinate Reference Systems are supported:
         *
         *     **Supported CRS** | **Parameter Value**
         *     ---------|----------
         *      **GDA2020** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *      **GDA94**| `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4283>`
         *      **WGS84** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326>`
         *     **AGD66** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4202>`
         *
         *     Example: `Accept-Crs=<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *
         *     You can find more information about EPSG codes and preferred transformations in NSW [here.](https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/230429/Common_Australian_EPSG_Codes_and_Transformations_Information_Sheet.pdf)
         *
         *     It is possible to customise the API request based on your project or application requirements.
         *     The following options are available:
         *
         *     ### Adjusting barcodes for bulk mail delivery
         *
         *     The Mailpoint API response includes barcode information that assists Australia Post for the purposes of bulk mail delivery. There are two parameters available for customising the barcode:
         *
         *     **barcodeFormat** – string (optional).
         *
         *     Customises the length of the barcode based on Australia Post formats.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *
         *     - `37Bar` - Barcode will be 37 characters in length
         *     - `52Bar` - Barcode will be 52 characters in length
         *     - `67Bar` - Barcode will be 67 characters in length
         *
         *     Default: `67Bar`
         *
         *     **barcodeData** – string (optional)
         *
         *     Allows for the inclusion of additional data in the barcode.
         *
         *     barcode Size/format  | No. of additional characters allowed
         *     ----------|-----------------------
         *     37 Characters   | N/A
         *     52 Characters   | Up to 5 characters
         *     67 Characters   | Up to 10 characters
         *
         *     `Example: barcodeFormat=67Bar`,`barcodeData=spatial`
         *
         *     Please see the following document for technical specifications
         *     https://auspost.com.au/content/dam/auspost_corp/media/documents/customer-barcode-technical-specifications-aug2012.pdf
         *
         *
         *     ## Suggestions for implementation
         *
         *     It is recommended that the following techniques are implemented in your application to reduce the handling errors:
         *
         *     ### Customising the request for your application
         *     It is possible to customise the API request based on your project or application requirements.
         *     The following options are available:
         *
         *     ### Handling for special characters "^" and "%"
         *
         *     The following special characters, `^` and `%`, are considered "unsafe" for use in URLs. Including these characters will result in an error in the client’s browser, preventing the request from being sent to the NSW Point Server.
         *
         *     This issue can occur in any input field on a web form where users can enter alphanumeric characters (e.g. the `address` input field in forms using the NSW Point ‘GET Suggested Addresses’ API).
         *
         *     Spatial Services recommend that developers implement validation in their application to prevent these characters from being entered by end-users to avoid this issue.
         *
         *     Please see the following link for additional information on unsafe characters: https://perishablepress.com/stop-using-unsafe-characters-in-urls/
         *
         *     ## Output Format
         *
         *     **Response Format:** [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)
         *
         *     **Object Style:** A single address `feature`
         *
         *     Each address 'feature' may include:
         *
         *     - A `geometry` object that contains the geographic coordinates for the address.
         *     - A `properties` object that includes parsed and unparsed address information and other address attributes.
         *     - Address matching attribution to assist in determining the quality and accuracy of the matched address.
         *     - A `query` attribute that includes the original input address.
         *     - A `parsedQuery` object that contains a parsed version of the input address.
         *
         *     > **Geographic coordinates** and the `geometry` object will only be returned in the MailPoint API response for physical addresses that are also found in GNAF. Postal-only addresses such as PO Boxes do not include location information.
         *
         *     ### Specific Attributes returned by MailPoint:
         *
         *     - `deliveryPointIdentifier` - An eight-digit code developed by Australia Post which enables each delivery point in Australia to be uniquely identified.
         *     - `barcode` - A series of vertical lines of specific variety of lengths, used to represent numerical and alphabetical characters.
         *     - `pafVersion` - The version of the database created by Australia Post containing Australian addresses in a correct address format, with their corresponding DPIDs.
         *     - `pafExpiry` - The expiry of the database created by Australia Post containing Australian addresses in a correct address format, with their corresponding DPIDs.
         *     - `matchDiagnostic` and `matchDiagnosticMessage` - Additional metadata to assist in determining the quality of the address match.
         *

         *     # Benefits
         *
         *     Administrative boundaries are essential for various analysis and reporting contexts, including emergency management, resource allocation, data collection and analysis, legal and jurisdictional clarity, public awareness and safety, and post-disaster recovery.
         *
         *     This API provides an excellent opportunity to enrich existing datasets that include coordinates but lack the related administrative information necessary to support analysis and government decision-making.
         *
         *     # Implementation and Best Practice
         *
         *     ## API Behaviour
         *
         *     The API performs a spatial intersect of the requested layers using the input coordinates and provides a response containing the attribution for each intersected layer.
         *
         *     If there is no administrative boundary data available for a 'layer' at the requested location, the response will include a message notifying the user of the missing data.
         *
         *     Example: `"Layer 'absBoundariesMeshBlock2011' not found."`
         *
         *     ## Input Format
         *
         *     The API requires the input of geographic coordinates as `latitude` and `longitude` in decimal degrees format. It also requires the selection of the administrative boundary layers you wish to return as a comma-separated list.
         *
         *     By default, the API accepts coordinates in the GDA94 Coordinate Reference System (CRS); however, other CRS are supported if require
         *
         *     *Accepted ‘layers’ values:*
         *
         *     - `absBoundariesMeshBlock2011`
         *     - `absBoundariesMeshBlock2016`
         *     - `absBoundariesMeshBlock2021`
         *     - `absBoundariesRemoteness2016`
         *     - `absBoundariesRemoteness2021`
         *     - `absBoundariesSeifa2021`
         *     - `electoralBoundariesCommonwealth`
         *     - `electoralBoundariesState`
         *     - `localities`
         *     - `localGovernmentAreas`
         *
         *     Example: `layers=absBoundariesMeshBlock2011,localities`
         *
         *     ## Defining the coordinate reference system (CRS) of your input
         *
         *     The API supports the input of coordinates in a variety of commonly used Australian CRS. By default, it expects coordinates to be in GDA94, however if your coordinates are in one of the other supported reference systems, you can use the `Content-Crs` parameter in your request header to nominate the preferred CRS.
         *
         *     The following coordinate reference systems are supported by the ‘Content-Crs’ header:
         *
         *     **Supported CRS** | **Parameter Value**
         *     ---------|----------
         *     **GDA2020** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *     **GDA94**| `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4283>`
         *     **WGS84** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326>`

         *     **Response Format:** [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)
         *
         *     **Object Style:** `featureCollection`
         *
         *     The API response will include a `feature` object for each requested `layer`. Some ‘layers’ may result in the return of multiple ‘feature’ objects e.g. ‘electoralBoundariesState’.
         *
         *     Each ‘feature’ will include a `properties` object that contains the attributes for that ‘layer’. Layers can be identified using the `layer` attribute and the list of names provided below:
         *
         *     - `absBoundariesMeshBlock2011`
         *     - `absBoundariesMeshBlock2016`
         *     - `absBoundariesMeshBlock2021`
         *     - `absBoundariesRemoteness2016`
         *     - `absBoundariesRemoteness2021`
         *     - `absBoundariesSeifa2021`
         *     - `electoralBoundariesCommonwealth`
         *     - `electoralBoundariesState`

        /**
         * Reverse Geocoder
         * @description Reverse geocoding is the process of using geographic coordinates to identify nearby address information. The NSW Point Reverse Geocoder provides authoritative address, property, parcel, and administrative data for any location within Australia.
         *
         *     # Benefits
         *
         *     The Reverse Geocoder provides intelligence and insight about the coordinate location, which can be used to aid government decision-making. For example, first responders can obtain crucial address, land parcel, and property information for a location during an emergency incident. This technology can assist government agencies in deploying efficient disaster management strategies and optimising resource allocation.
         *
         *     # Implementation and Best Practice
         *
         *     ## API Behaviour
         *
         *     By default, the Reverse Geocoder uses the cases below to identify the nearest useful result for the input coordinate location. The API also includes a variety of optional parameters that can be used to customise/control the process.
         *
         *     **Reverse Geocoder Cases in order of execution:**
         *
         *     Order | Case | Description | Result
         *     ---------|----------|----------|----------
         *     1 | **Property Level** | Input coordinates intersect a Property polygon | The nearest related property address is returned
         *     2 | **Address Level**| Complete address found within than 200m radius of input coordinates | Return the nearest ‘address’ matchType
         *     3 | **Street Level** | Street matchType found between 200m and 1000m radius of input coordinates | Return the nearest ‘street’ matchType
         *     4 | **Locality Level** | Search extends beyond 1000m radius of input coordinates | Nearest ‘locality’ matchType returned
         *
         *     > It is strongly recommended that you utilise the `matchDistance` value included in the API response with each result, to assist in determining its quality and suitability for your application purposes.
         *
         *     ## Input Format
         *
         *     The API uses the GDA94 Coordinate Reference System (CRS) by default and requires the input of geographic coordinates as `latitude` and `longitude` in decimal degrees format.
         *
         *     ## Customising the request for your application
         *
         *     It is possible to customise the API request based on your project or application requirements.
         *
         *     The following optional parameters are available:
         *
         *     ### Filter by matchType
         *
         *     You can use the `matchType` parameter to overwrite the default API behaviour (described above) and force it to return a result based on the requested ‘matchType’ value. For example, `matchType=street` will ignore nearby complete addresses and *always* return the nearest **Street Level** result regardless of its distance from the input location.
         *
         *     If ‘matchType’ is not included in a request, the API will attempt to return the best result it can for the input coordinate location, based upon the cases provided above in the API Behaviour section.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *     - `primaryAddress`
         *     - `secondaryAddress`
         *     - `address`
         *     - `street`
         *     - `locality`
         *
         *     Example: `matchType=address`
         *
         *     ### Maximum number of nearby addresses returned
         *
         *     By default, the API returns only one address for the **Property Level** and **Address Level** cases described in the API Behaviour section above. The `maxResults` parameter allows you to adjust the number of addresses that the API will offer for these two cases, up to a maximum of 20.
         *
         *     When multiple addresses are returned by the API, they will be ranked by the `matchDistance` value from nearest to farthest from the input cooridnate location. If two or more suggestions have the same ‘matchDistance’ value, they will be treated as equal matches and listed in no specific order.
         *
         *     ***Note:** The return of multiple addresses is limited to addresses identified by Property intersection or addresses within 200m of the input coordinate location. If no address are found within these conditions, only a single result will be returned.*
         *
         *     Example: `maxResults=10`
         *
         *     ### State/Territory Filtering
         *
         *     You can use the `stateFilter` parameter to restrict the API's responses to one or more Australian states or territories. To do so, separate each abbreviated state or territory name with a comma. If `stateFilter` is not used, the API will return suggestions from all Australian states and territories.
         *
         *     Example: `stateFilter=NSW,QLD`
         *
         *     ### Source Dataset Filtering
         *
         *     The `dataset` parameter allows you to nominate the dataset you are returning your address suggestions from. Dataset options include:
         *
         *     - **GNAF** – The most comprehensive national address dataset that includes authoritative and non-authoritative addresses from multiple contributors (updated quarterly) e.g. `dataset=gnaf`
         *     - **GNAF Live/Geoscape continuousAddress** – The most current authoritative address dataset (updated daily from the Australian State and Territory address jurisdictions) e.g. `dataset=continuousAddress`
         *
         *     If no dataset is nominated in your request, addresses will be returned from all datasets.
         *
         *     ***Note:** If you are using `dataset=continuousAddress`, it is suggested that you also include `matchType=address` in your request to force the API to return a result when an address in not found within 200m of the input coordinates (see API Behaviour section above for further information). This is because the GNAF Live dataset does not include Street or Locality ‘matchTypes’.*
         *
         *     Example: `dataset=gnaf`
         *
         *     ### Alias/Principal Address Filtering
         *
         *     The `excludeAliases` parameter determines whether alias addresses will be returned by the Reverse Geocoder. **Alias addresses** are non-authoritative addresses that have been provided by an address contributor or determined programmatically. For example, “10-12 SMITH STREET" could be an alias for the principal address: “10 SMITH STREET”.
         *
         *     By default, alias suggestions are included in the API response. If you *do not* want to receive alias addresses, you must set the ‘excludeAliases’ value to ‘true’.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *     - **true**: Excludes alias addresses from the response, only addresses with an `"aliasPrincipal":"PRINCIPAL"` will be returned.
         *     - **false** (default): Includes both ALIAS and PRINCIPAL addresses in the response.
         *
         *     Example: `excludeAliases=True`
         *
         *     ### Filter by geoFeature
         *
         *     The `minGeoFeatureLevel` parameter provides filtering based on the level of geoFeature accuracy. It operates as a “sliding scale” and allows you to define the minimum spatial accuracy you are willing to accept for your geocoding result. For example, `minGeoFeatureLevel=address` will only return matches that have a spatial accuracy of property address or better. Whilst, `minGeoFeatureLevel=streetLocality` will return suggestions from the categories of ‘address’, ‘approximate’, or ‘streetLocality’. For more information on ‘geoFeature’ values and the minGeoFeatureLevel categories,  see [geoFeature]( https://api-docs.geoscape.com.au/docs/oas-addresses-api/2949837e92418-geo-).
         *
         *     If ‘minGeoFeatureLevel’ is not included in a request, the API will attempt to return the best suggestions it can for the input address, regardless of their geoFeature value.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *     - `address`
         *     - `approximate`
         *     - `streetLocality`
         *     - `locality`
         *
         *     ***Note:** The ‘minGeoFeatureLevel’ parameter adheres to the rules applied by the cases described in the API Behaviour section above. E.g. If `minGeoFeatureLevel=address` and no Property Level or Address Level cases are found, the API will *not* return a result.*
         *
         *     ### Requesting Additional Properties for Address Location
         *
         *     The API includes functionality that allows to you request a variety of other information related to the physical address location. These items are requested using the optional parameter `additionalProperties`.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *     - `asgsMain`
         *     - `asgsRemoteness`
         *     - `commonwealthElectorate`
         *     - `localGovernmentArea`
         *     - `parcelBundle`
         *     - `propertyBundle`
         *     - `seifa`
         *     - `stateElectorateBundle`
         *
         *     Example: `additionalProperties=parcelBundle,localGovernmentArea`
         *
         *     For more information on `additionalProperties` values and administrative boundary data, please refer to our [Additional Properties Knowledgebase Article](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/knowledge-base.html#additional-properties).
         *
         *     ### Defining the coordinate reference system (CRS) of your input
         *
         *     The API supports the input of coordinates in a variety of commonly used Australian CRS. By default, it expects coordinates to be in GDA94, however if your coordinates are in one of the other supported reference systems, you can use the `Content-Crs` parameter in your request header to nominate the preferred CRS.
         *
         *     The following coordinate reference systems are supported by the ‘Content-Crs’ header:
         *
         *     Supported CRS | Parameter Value
         *     ---------|----------
         *     **GDA2020** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *     **GDA94**| `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4283>`
         *     **WGS84** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326>`
         *     **AGD66** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4202>`
         *

         *     ### Requesting Geographic Coordinates in a Different Reference System
         *
         *     The API can be configured to return the geographic coordinates in the response using the `Accept-Crs` parameter in your request header.
         *
         *     The following Coordinate Reference Systems are supported:
         *
         *     Supported CRS | Parameter Value
         *     ---------|----------
         *     **GDA2020** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *     **GDA94**| `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4283>`
         *     **WGS84** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326>`
         *     **AGD66** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4202>`
         *
         *     Example: `Accept-Crs=<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *
         *     You can find more information about EPSG codes and preferred transformations in NSW [here](https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/230429/Common_Australian_EPSG_Codes_and_Transformations_Information_Sheet.pdf).
         *
         *     ## Output Format
         *
         *     **Response Format:** [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/)
         *
         *     **Object Style:** `featureCollection` containing 1 or more address `feature` objects
         *
         *     Address features may include the following:
         *
         *     - A `geometry` object that contains the geographic coordinates for the address.
         *     - A `properties` object that includes parsed and unparsed address information and other attributes.
         *     - The 'properties' of each 'feature' will also include any 'additionalProperties' that were requested with the address e.g. administrative boundaries, cadastral and property information, etc.
         *     - `matchType`, `matchDistance` and `matchMethod` attribution to assist in determining the quality and accuracy of the reverse geocoding result.
         *     - A `query` attribute that includes the original input address.
         *
         *     ### Match Quality Metadata
         *
         *     The Reverse Geocoder includes match quality metadata as part of its response. This information assists customers to understand the quality and confidence of the matches that are returned by the API.
         *
         *     Attribute | Description | Example
         *     ---------|----------|----------
         *     **matchType** | Broadly categorises the type of match that has been returned by the API and its approximate spatial accuracy. Values include: `Primary Address`, `Secondary Address`, `Street`, `Locality` | `"matchType": "Primary Address"`
         *     **matchDistance**| The approximate distance in metres (m) between the input location and the point feature provided in the API response. Matches with a lower distance value can be treated with a higher degree of confidence because they indicate that the address location is near to the input location. | `"matchDistance": 79.05`
         *     **matchMethod** | The method used to derive the match e.g. spatial intersection or measured distance between features. Possible 'matchMethod' values are: `Property Polygon Intersect`, `Address Point Distance`, `Street Locality Point Distance`, `Locality Polygon Intersect`,`Locality Point Distance`. These values correspond to the selection process used to derive the match as described in the [Reverse Geocoder Cases](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/api-document.html#/paths/api-reverseGeocoder/get#api-behaviour). | `"matchMethod": "Property Polygon Intersect"`
         *
         *     > For more information on how **match quality metadata** can be utilised when implementing the **Reverse Geocoder** in an application, please [contact us](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/contact-us.html).

         * Cadastral Parcel
         * @description The Cadastral Parcel API allows you to validate a State or National parcel reference (e.g., Lot, Section, Plan Label) and returns a variety of information about that parcel, including:
         *     - Title status
         *     - Date created/modified
         *     - A unique identifier that can be used to link to NSW Foundation Cadastral Data ('contributorId')
         *     - A unique identifier that can be used to link to Geoscapes National Cadastral Product ('cadastrePid')
         *     - Related addresses, property details, and administrative boundary information
         *
         *     > The cadastral data served via this API is sourced from Geoscape’s National Cadastral Product. This dataset is updated monthly due to the current constraints of jurisdiction supply chains. Future enhancements aim to include more frequent updates to data currency.
         *
         *     # Benefits
         *
         *     Integration with GIS platforms, property management systems, and databases allows seamless access to authoritative cadastral and property information for decision-making processes.
         *
         *     Access to:
         *     - Authoritative national cadastral, address, coordinate, and property information.
         *     - Administrative boundaries (Local Government Areas, State and Federal Electoral Divisions, ASGS Meshblock, Remoteness, SEIFA information).
         *     - Customisable Coordinate Reference Systems (GDA94, GDA2020, WGS84, AGD66).
         *
         *     # Implementation and Best Practice
         *
         *     ## API Behaviour
         *
         *     This API requires the input of a cadastral parcel reference as a single string (e.g.`parcelId=279/823425`). It returns a JSON response with a `parcelBundle` object that contains information about the validated parcel.
         *
         *     By default, the API will also return a single address related to the parcel where one can be found. The address and its attributes will be returned in an embedded GeoJSON `Feature Collection` object.
         *
         *     ### Parcels with multiple addresses
         *
         *     Many parcels include more than one related address in Australia (e.g., retirement villages, residential villages, residential or commercial apartment blocks, or private residences with a secondary dwelling). The total number of addresses related to a parcel is returned in the “numberMatched” attribute of the `links` object in the API response.
         *
         *     It is possible to customise the API response to return all addresses for a parcel if required. However, due to the potentially large number of addresses and their impact on response size, it is recommended that “pagination” (see below) be implemented to assist in managing the data.
         *
         *     ## Input Format
         *
         *     The API requires the input of a `parcelId` as a single string e.g.`parcelId=279/823425`
         *
         *     'parcelId'  is a national cadastral reference maintained by Geoscape in their cadastre product. It represents a combination of lot and plan style information sourced directly from the associated state or territories land registry systems.
         *
         *     All other parameters are optional.
         *
         *     If your application requirements are for NSW cadastral information only, we recommend using the "NSW Parcel Id Construction" process shown below to simplify the form for your customers and control the quality/format of the 'parcelId' that is submitted to our API.
         *
         *     If you anticipate your customers submitting a 'parcelId' for other State and Territories also, please refer to the [Geoscape Cadastre Product Guide](https://docs.geoscape.com.au/projects/cadastre_guide/en/stable/technical_description.html#attributes) for information regarding 'parcelId' formats for other jurisdictions.
         *
         *     ### NSW Parcel Id construction
         *
         *     For NSW, `parcelId`is comprised of Lot, Section, Plan Type and/or Plan Number information.
         *
         *     DCS Spatial Services recommends that customers using this API in online forms for the collection of NSW Parcel Ids, create separate input boxes for Lot, Section, Plan Type, and Plan Number. The values of these input boxes can then be combined to create a valid `parcelId` using the formulas below.
         *
         *     It is also suggested that the values for Plan Type should be selectable options that include: “DP” or “SP” only.
         *
         *     *For an example of NSW Parcel Id implementation, please see the **Cadastral Parcel** form on our [Sample Forms](https://do6azroidhmm1.cloudfront.net/docs/pages/sample-forms.html) page.*
         *
         *     The table below provides the formulas for constructing NSW Parcel Ids:
         *
         *     Land Parcel Type | Formula | Example
         *     ---------|----------|----------
         *     **Deposited Plan without Section information** | LOTNUMBER + “/” + PLANNUMBER | `parcelId=279/823425`
         *     **Deposited Plan with Section information**| LOTNUMBER + “/” + SECTIONNUM + “/” + PLANNUMBER | `parcelId=17/33/758770`
         *     **Strata Plan** | LOTNUMBER + “/” + PLANTYPE + PLANNUMBER | `parcelId=1/SP40409`
         *
         *     ## Customising the request for your application
         *
         *     It is possible to customise the API request based on your project or application requirements.
         *
         *     The following optional parameters are available:
         *
         *     ### Pagination of API results
         *
         *     The Cadastral Parcels API includes functionality to assist in implementing pagination in a web application.
         *
         *     This functionality is valuable when a parcel includes a large number of related addresses, as it allows you to request the addresses in smaller, more manageable batches. This reduces the API response time and enables you to control the number of addresses displayed per page.
         *
         *     The input parameters: `limit` and `offset` can be used to manage the maximum number of address records to return per page, and the starting record. Whilst the `links` object in the API response includes the following information:
         *     - `numberMatched` – The total number of addresses that are related to the parcel.
         *     - `numberReturned` – The number of addresses returned in the current response.
         *     - `self` – A generated URL that can be used to refresh the currently requested record set.
         *     - `next` – A generated URL that can be used request the next record set from the total records.
         *     - `previous` – A generated URL that can be used request the previous record set from the total records.
         *
         *     **Pagination parameters:**
         *
         *     - `limit` - sets the maximum number of addresses to return in a single request. The range is 1-1000 and the default is 1.
         *     - `offset` - Identifies the starting record that should be returned by the API. The range is 0-999 and the default is 0.
         *
         *     **Example of a request using pagination:**
         *
         *     `https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/api/cadastralParcel?parcelId=433/41582&limit=10&offset=0`
         *
         *     **Example of the links section of the response for the above request:**
         *     ```json
         *     "links": {
         *             "numberMatched": 125,
         *             "numberReturned": 10,
         *             "self": "/v3/api/cadastralParcel?parcelId=433/41582&offset=0&limit=10",
         *             "next": "/v3/api/cadastralParcel?parcelId=433/41582&offset=10&limit=10"
         *         }
         *     ```
         *
         *     ### Address Dataset Filtering
         *
         *     The `dataset` parameter allows you to restrict the dataset you are returning related addresses from. This can be very useful when you only want to return *authoritative addresses* for validated 'pacelId's'.
         *
         *     Dataset options include:
         *
         *     - **GNAF** – The most comprehensive national address dataset that includes *authoritative* and *non-authoritative* addresses from multiple contributors (updated quarterly) e.g. `dataset=gnaf`
         *     - **GNAF Live/Geoscape continuousAddress** – The most current *authoritative* address dataset (updated daily from the Australian State and Territory address jurisdictions) e.g. `dataset=continuousAddress`
         *
         *     If no dataset is nominated in your request, addresses will be returned from all datasets.
         *
         *     Example: `dataset=continuousAddress`
         *
         *     ### Alias/Principal Address Filtering
         *
         *     The `excludeAliases` parameter allows you to force the exclusion of alias addresses from the Cadastral Parcels API (e.g. addresses where `"aliasPrincipal": "ALIAS"`). **Alias addresses** are non-authoritative addresses that have been provided by an address contributor or determined programmatically. For example, “10-12 SMITH STREET" could be an alias for the principal address: “10 SMITH STREET”.
         *
         *     By default, alias addresses are included in the API response. If you *do not* want to receive alias addresses, you must set the ‘excludeAliases’ value to ‘true’.
         *
         *     Use of the 'excludeAliases' parameter will not restrict the validation of the input 'parcelId'. It will only limit the type of addresses that might be returned with the validated 'parcelId'.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *     - **true**: Excludes alias addresses from the response, only addresses with an `"aliasPrincipal": "PRINCIPAL"` will be returned.
         *     - **false** (default): Includes both ALIAS and PRINCIPAL addresses in the response.
         *
         *     Example: `excludeAliases=True`
         *
         *     ### Requesting additional properties for address locations
         *     The API includes functionality that allows to you request a variety of other information related to the physical address location. These items are requested using the optional parameter `additionalProperties`.
         *
         *     *Accepted values:*
         *     - `asgsMain`
         *     - `asgsRemoteness`
         *     - `commonwealthElectorate`
         *     - `localGovernmentArea`
         *     - `propertyBundle`
         *     - `seifa`
         *     - `stateElectorateBundle`
         *
         *     Example: `additionalProperties=stateElectorateBundle,localGovernmentArea`
         *
         *     ***Note:** The contents of 'parcelBundle' are returned in the default response by this API. Therefore it is not available as an 'additionalProperties' option.*
         *
         *     For more information on 'additionalProperties' values and administrative boundary data, please refer to our [Additional Properties Knowledgebase Article](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/knowledge-base.html#additional-properties).
         *
         *     ### Requesting geographic coordinates in a different reference system
         *
         *     The API can be configured to return the geographic coordinates in the response using the `Accept-Crs` parameter in your request header.
         *
         *     The following Coordinate Reference Systems are supported:
         *
         *     **Supported CRS** | **Parameter Value**
         *     ---------|----------
         *     **GDA2020** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *     **GDA94**| `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4283>`
         *     **WGS84** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4326>`
         *     **AGD66** | `<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/4202>`
         *
         *     Example: `Accept-Crs=<https://www.opengis.net/def/crs/EPSG/0/7844>`
         *
         *     You can find more information about EPSG codes and preferred transformations in NSW [here.](https://www.spatial.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0020/230429/Common_Australian_EPSG_Codes_and_Transformations_Information_Sheet.pdf)
         *
         *     ## Suggestions for implementation
         *
         *     ### Data complexity - A Word of Caution!
         *
         *     The relationships among cadastral parcels, properties, and addresses in Australia are complex. Generally, most parcels have one related property and at least one address. However, there are various edge cases and scenarios within the data that can affect this outcome.
         *
         *     Some known examples in NSW data that may impact the Cadastral Parcels API include:
         *
         *     - **Parcels that do not return related addresses** - A response that does not include any related addresses can result from a parcel that is part of a larger property made up of multiple parcels, where the validated parcel does not contain an address geocode. Alternatively, it could be because the parcel has not been assigned a complete address by the responsible address authority.
         *
         *     - **Stratum Parcels** - The NSW Cadastre currently provides a 2D representation of cadastral parcels that are at 'ground level' only. Any parcels found above or below ground level will not be included in the cadastral fabric and cannot be validated using the NSW Point Cadastral Parcel API. This includes parcels for underground mining leases, underground car parks or basement levels, and developments that include parcels positioned in the airspace above ground level.
         *
         *     - **Parcels with ambiguous property or address relationships** -  Some parcels may have more than one related property or primary or secondary address record. These ambiguous relationships can have unforeseen impacts on the expected behaviour of the API.
         *
         *     *If you have any concerns or questions regarding the impact of these scenarios on your application, please contact our support team for advice [here](https://point.digital.nsw.gov.au/v3/docs/pages/contact-us.html)*

         *     The following special characters, `^` and `%`, are considered "unsafe" for use in URLs. Including these characters will result in an error in the client’s browser, preventing the request from being sent to the NSW Point Server.
         *
         *     This issue can occur in any input field on a web form where users can enter alphanumeric characters (e.g. the `address` input field in forms using the NSW Point ‘GET Suggested Addresses’ API).
         *
         *     Spatial Services recommend that developers implement validation in their application to prevent these characters from being entered by end-users to avoid this issue.
         *
         *     Please see the following link for additional information on unsafe characters: https://perishablepress.com/stop-using-unsafe-characters-in-urls/
         *
         *     ## Output Format
         *
         *     **Response Format:** JSON usually containing a [GeoJSON](https://geojson.org/) `featureCollection` object.
         *
         *     The output will include the cadastral information for the validated 'parcelId' in the `parcelBundle` object.
         *
         *     If the response includes related addresses, they will be provided in a GeoJSON 'featureCollection' object.
         *
         *     The 'featureCollection' will include:
         *     - a `links` object, which provides the information necessary for implementng pagination.
         *     - One or more address `feature` objects.
         *
         *     Each 'feature' will include:
         *
         *     - A `geometry` object that contains the geographic coordinates for the address.
         *     - A `properties` object that includes standard NSW Point address objects and attributes.
         *     - The 'properties' of each 'feature' will also include any 'additionalProperties' that were requested with the 'parcelId' e.g. administrative boundaries and property information, etc.

Mesh Blocks are intended to serve as the fundamental spatial unit for future statistical and administrative geography.
         *
         *     Mesh Blocks, along with other statistical areas, are defined using the Australian Statistical Geography Standard (ASGS) by the ABS. The ASGS provides a unified framework for all regions used in ABS statistical publications. First implemented for the 2011 Census of Population and Housing, it has been progressively introduced into other ABS data collections since July 1, 2011. Updated ABS boundaries were released for the 2021 Census.
